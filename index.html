            <h2>About Rachel and Tony</h2>
            <div class='col-md-10 col-md-offset-1'>
                <div class='highlight'>The Start</div>
                <div class='text'>Tony &amp; Rachel first met in February 2011 at UC Berkeley's Department of Chemical Engineering grad school visit weekend, where Rachel was an overly enthusiastic prospective student and Tony an experienced third year. There they spent an hour having a great conversation at Prof. Smit's house, though Rachel has no memory of this. When Rachel came to Berkeley for grad school, they re-met at a College of Chemistry Electric Fielders summer softball game. After a second great conversation, Tony got  Rachel's phone number and texted her to invite her to a barbeque that weekend. Unfortunately, Rachel accidentally gave him the wrong number and both of them wondered why they never heard from the other! Luckily, they ran into each other in the hallway at the College of Chemistry and figured out their mistake. </div>

                <div class='text'> Though they saw each other again at numerous ChemE social events, including singing Journey together at the Shattuck Down-Low for Barbara's birthday and dancing together at the Graduate Assembly Social at Kip's,  they like to remember their first date as being at Bette's Oceanview Diner, where Tony took Rachel to breakfast at what continues to be their favorite brunch place. After they finished eating, Rachel asked what they should do next, to which he replied "Well, I kinda want to go to the lumber yard." So, after a delicious brunch at an upscale restaurant on 4th street, they spent the second part of their date wandering around MacBeath's Hardwood comparing the prices of walnut versus cherry for Tony's latest woodworking project. When Rachel was game to spend a Saturday afternoon picking out rough-cut lumber, he knew he had found a special girl!</div>

                <div class='highlight'>The Follow-up</div>
                <div class='text'>After a second, more typical, date at Esperpento in San Francisco, and a third hiking in Tilden Regional Park, they quickly started spending most of their time together. Tony became a frequent visitor to Ward Street and Rachel was always popping by the Newman lab and hanging out at 1257 Francisco where Tony lived. During these times, they found out that they got along really well with each other's friends, something that was very important to both of them. Alan, Craig, Cynthia, Hedvig, Lin, Nate and Rachel C. all spent a lot of time with Tony and Rachel during those crucial first few months of dating, and together they helped set a solid foundation of laughter and trust for Tony and Rachel's developing relationship.</div>

                <div class='text'>In the subsequent years, Tony and Rachel have had many adventures together. They have taken trips both near and far to Chicago, Malta and the Amalfi coast, Thailand, Barbados, Wenatchee, Montana, Bali and many more.  They have cooked hundred of meals and desserts together, built furniture together, gone on road trips together, discovered new restaurants and bars together, hiked new trails together, been silly together, run a half marathon together, played board games together, and overall spent an incredible 4 years.</div>

                <div class='highlight'>The Proposal</div>
                <div class='text'>After spending Christmas in Switzerland visiting their friends, they traveled to Paris where Tony proposed to Rachel on January 1st, 2015 in the garden at the point of the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute;. It was a beautiful winter day and they were sharing a typical French picnic of brie, smoked salmon, baguette and Rachel's favorite Juran&ccedil;on wine. Tony gave Rachel a beautiful wooden box he had made out of cherry and purple heart and had inlaid with her initials. When she opened it, she saw the incredible diamond ring he had designed for her with rose gold, white gold, and small purple sapphires. Rachel immediately said "YES!" before Tony even had a chance to ask the question that he had been preparing for the last 3 months.</div>

                    <div class = 'text'>Cynthia &amp; Rachel met during UC Berkeley's grad school visit weekend, and bonded the following weekend while touring San Francisco for Stanford's visit weekend! They did live together for a year in the Allston girl's house, but regardless of where they were living, have spent most of their free time together over the last 4+ years, though often in the company of Tony and Lin. Cynthia &amp; Rachel love exploring new restaurants, bars, recipes, activities (recently stand-up paddle boarding &amp; pottery making to name a few), cities (including visiting Austin, TX and Portland, OR with Lin) and more. They are also museum buddies, sharing a pass to San Francisco museums where they try to catch many of the special exhibits. No matter the location, Cynthia &amp; Rachel can usually be found discussing various important life topics, something that has really helped Rachel grow.</div>

                    <div class = 'text'>Ellie &amp; Rachel met on the first day of their MIT sailing pre-orientation program in August of 2006. Their friendship got off to a bit of a rocky start when Rachel accidentally flooded Ellie's cell phone and then made her lug a ton of stuff to their new room while she went to a meeting. Despite that beginning, Ellie &amp; Rachel were college roommates and sailing teammates for 3 amazing years and their shared love of sailing, reading and cooking has kept them close friends for the last 9! Rachel felt extremely lucky that Ellie was moving back to California at the same time she was starting grad school there, and in the last 4 years she has gotten to know Tony during frequent reunions the girls have had.</div>

                    <div class = 'text'>Lin &amp; Rachel also met in February 2011 during UC Berkeley's grad school visit weekend, where they were both visiting from Europe. Lin was doing a Fulbright Scholarship in Sweden at the same time Rachel was Fulbrighting in France, and they managed to meet up the next month in Berlin where they were both attending the Fulbright conference. When they both decided to attend Berkeley for grad school, they knew they wanted to live together! They were roommates for 2 years until Rachel moved in with Tony, and have been very close friends &amp; labmates for all of grad school. Lin &amp; Rachel share most of the same hobbies, including rock climbing, biking, swimming, hiking, cooking, windsurfing, travelling and more! Lin has been the behind-the-scenes help for many of Rachel's baking adventures and Rachel could never have gotten through the turmoil of grad school without Lin's constant support!</div>

                    <div class = 'text'>Hedvig &amp; Rachel first met face-to-face in August 2011 after they had signed a lease with Lin to live together in a 3-bedroom apartment on Ward Street in Berkeley. The three of them were pretty much inseparable for the following year, which was Lin &amp; Rachel's first year in grad school and Hedvig's year doing a Fulbright Scholarship from Sweden at UC Berkeley. Rachel also gives credit to Hedvig for the fact that she and Tony got together in the first place, since Hedvig was always rooting for Tony in those initial months when Rachel wasn't sure where their relationship was going! Despite moving away in 2012, Hedvig has remained an important part of Tony &amp; Rachel's lives, with Tony visiting her in Sweden and Hedvig visiting the Bay Area.</div>

                    <div class = 'text'>Tania &amp; Rachel met in the summer of 2008 in Pau, France when they were both doing internships at the oil company Total. As the 2 young, foreign interns who loved to discover new cities and cultures, they immediately started travelling together. In the first summer they went to Biarritz, Bilbao, Lourdes and Venice, and, despite almost continuously living across the Atlantic from each other, they have met at least once every year since to travel to new countries including Iceland, Russia, Portugal, Sweden, Monaco, Finland and Italy. Rachel also credits Tania for teaching her French, since, having moved to France the year before, she was already fluent but understood the difficulties of learning the language! They also were lucky enough to both be living in Paris from 2010-2011, and they frequently met up to cook, run and visit museums together. In 2013, Tony and Rachel travelled to Malta and Italy's Amalfi coast with Tania and her now husband J&oslash;rgen. The two couples got along fabulously and had an amazing trip!</div>
